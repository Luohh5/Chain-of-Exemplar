Atoms are always moving.\nThe energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in a substance depends on three things: the type of atoms in the substance, the amount of the substance, and how fast the atoms are moving.\nTemperature measures how hot or cold the atoms of a substance are. If the atoms in a substance are moving faster, the temperature is higher. The temperature of a substance depends on the type of atoms in the substance and the amount of the substance.\nAll solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. A substance cannot exist by itself. For example, air is not a substance of its own. Instead, air is a mixture of many different substances.\nWhen two or more substances are mixed, the total temperature of the mixture depends on each substance's temperature. For example, if paper and glass are mixed, the temperature of the mixture is higher than either substance's temperature by itself.\nThink about mixing paper and glass. The paper has a higher temperature than the glass. So, the mixture has a higher temperature than either substance by itself.\nTemperature can also affect the energy of a substance. The energy of a substance depends on three things: the type of atoms in the substance, the amount of the substance, and how fast the atoms are moving. This is shown in the figure below.\nThere are two types of thermal energy. The lower energy is called latent heat. The higher energy is called sensible heat.\nLatent heat is used to help substances change into different states, such as liquid and gas. For example, water vaporises into water when heat is added to liquid water. The heat added changes the latent energy of the water into sensible energy. The water then starts to vaporise.\nSensible heat is used to help substances change into different states or to make substances move. For example, heating a substance of 50\u00b0F makes it start to vaporise. The heat added changes the sensible energy of the substance into thermal energy.\nIf the temperature of a substance increases, the thermal energy of the substance also increases. The temperature of a substance decreases, or the temperature gets lower, the thermal energy of the substance also decreases. The temperature of a substance stays the same, or the temperature gets the same, the thermal energy of the substance stays the same.The cold watermelon has less thermal energy than the hot watermelon."}, {"id": "identity_11369", "response": "A simple sentence is a sentence with only one subject and predicate.\nThe pitcher threw the ball to first base.\nA compound sentence is two simple sentences joined by a comma and a conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.\nThe pitcher threw the ball, and the batter hit it.\nSome simple sentences have a compound subject or a compound predicate, but they are not compound sentences.\nAnna and James will watch the fireworks tonight.\nThis simple sentence has a compound subject, Anna and James.\nThe singers bowed and walked off the stage.\nThis simple sentence has a compound predicate, bowed and walked off the stage.\nSome simple sentences have introductory phrases, but they are not compound sentences.

Scientists classify animals with similar traits into a group.To decide if an animal is part of a group, look at the traits of the group.\nPlacental mammals have the following traits:\nThey give birth to live offspring.\nThey have fur or hair.\nCompare each animal's traits to the group's traits. Select the animal with traits similar to the group's traits.\nA sea otter has the following traits:\nIt gives birth to live offspring.\nIt has fur.\nA sea otter has the traits of a placental mammal.

The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re\u00adacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nA piece of apple turning brown is a chemical change.

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene.

A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene.

Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait.

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.\nAn organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.\nAn organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.\nThe types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.\nA recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene.

Select the animal with traits similar to the group's traits.\nAn anchovy has the following traits:\nIt has fins, not limbs.\nIt lives underwater.\nIt has a skeleton made of bone.\nIt makes eggs with no shells.\nAn anchovy has the traits of a bony fish. A bony fish is a type of fish.\nA humpback whale does not have all of the traits of a bony fish. A humpback whale has fins, not limbs. It does not live underwater. It does not have a skeleton made of bone. It makes eggs with no shells."}, {"id": "identity_15561", "response": "Salt Lake City is the capital of Utah."}, {"id": "identity_15583", "response": "Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.\nThese pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The stronger the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.\nYou can change the strength of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnetic force is stronger when the magnets are closer together.Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are closer together, the magnetic force between them is stronger.\nThe magnets in Pair 1 are closer together than the magnets in Pair 2. So, the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."}, {"id": "identity_15584", "response": "Every object is made of one or more materials. A material is a type of matter. Wood, glass, metal, and plastic are common materials.\nA material has different properties. A material's properties tell you how it looks, feels, tastes, or smells.Hard is a property. A hard material keeps its shape when you press on it with your finger.\nLook at each picture, one at a time. Imagine pushing on the material shown in each picture.\nOf the choices, the metal trombone is harder. If you press on a trombone, it will not change shape."}, {"id": "identity_15586", "response": "Birds, mammals, fish, reptiles, and amphibians are groups of animals. The animals in each group have traits in common.\nScientists sort animals into groups based on traits they have in common. This process is called classification.A sea otter is a mammal. It has fur and feeds its young milk.\nSea otters have large front flippers. They use their flippers to swim and walk on land.\nA penguin is a bird. It has feathers, two wings, and a beak.\nPenguins live near the ocean. They swim in the water to catch fish and other food.\nA king penguin is a species of penguin. It is larger and has a different beak shape than other penguins.\nA clownfish is a fish. It lives underwater. It has fins, not limbs.\nClownfish live in coral reefs. They often live in groups called schools."}, {"id": "identity_15592", "response": "There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.\nA substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.\nScientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.\nIn a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color. Each color represents a different chemical element. The legend shows the color and the atomic symbol for each chemical element in the substance."}, {"id": "identity_15597", "response": "Figures of speech are words or phrases that use language in a nonliteral or unusual way.

The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.\nThe kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy.Each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. The particles in sample A also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.\nBecause the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."}]
