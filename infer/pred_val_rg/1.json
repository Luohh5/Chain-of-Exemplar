The direction of the arrows indicates that the magnetic force is in opposite directions for some pairs, and the same direction for others. Therefore, the correct statement about the magnitude of the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair is that it is different for each pair."}, {"id": "identity_2119", "response": "Michigan is the farthest north of these states."}, {"id": "identity_2120", "response": "The metaphor in this text suggests that the snoring of the grandfather is loud and resembling the sound of a bear.
