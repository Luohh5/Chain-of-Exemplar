This is because the magnets in Pair 1 are closer together and have a larger surface area exposed to each other, which increases the magnetic force between them. In contrast, the magnets in Pair 2 are farther apart and have less surface area exposed to each other, resulting in a smaller magnetic force between them."}, {"id": "identity_3717", "response": "The sentence \"Mom taught me how to bake bread\" uses the past tense.

Therefore, we can write:\n\nv1 = d2 / t1\nv2 = d1 / t2\n\nSubstituting the values we know, we get:\n\nv1 = 55 miles / 5 hours = 11 miles per hour\nv2 = 55 miles / 5 hours = 11 miles per hour\n\nSince v1 = v2, we can conclude that both blue whales were moving at the same speed, which is 11 miles per hour.
