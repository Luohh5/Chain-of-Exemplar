Therefore, there are two friends in total who are being pulled by the wagon. \n\nHowever, the question asks for the mass of one of the friends, specifically the friend who weighs 35 pounds. \n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use the law of conservation of momentum, which states that the total momentum of an isolated system remains constant if no external forces act on it. \n\nSince the wagon is pulling the friend, the momentum of the wagon and the friend must be the same. Let's assume that the wagon has a mass of m and is moving with a velocity v. Then, the momentum of the wagon and the friend can be calculated as:\n\np = m * v\n\nIf the friend is sitting in the wagon, their mass must be equal to the mass of the wagon, which we can assume to be m. Therefore, the momentum of the friend can be calculated as:\n\np' = m * v\n\nSince the momentum of the friend is equal to that of the wagon, we can write:\n\np' = p\n\np = m * v = m * v = p'\n\nTherefore, the momentum of the friend is equal to that of the wagon.
