An organism with only recessive alleles for the thorns gene cannot have thorns. So, the recessive allele represents the expected ratio of offspring without thorns to offspring with thorns. The Punnett square shows you that each box with the genotype rr represents an organism without thorns.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with thorns to offspring without thorns is 0:4.

Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. \nBecause there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.\nAn event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:\nprobability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes\nYou can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nConsider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:\nnumber of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4"}, {"id": "identity_1339", "response": "The purpose of an advertisement is to persuade people to do something.

Most animals' fur grows downward, which helps rainwater run down off the animal. Sloths' fur, however, grows upward. When a sloth is hanging upside down, rainwater is still directed off its body.

Most animals' fur grows downward, which helps rainwater run down off the animal. Sloths' fur, however, grows upward. When a sloth is hanging upside down, rainwater is still directed off its body. This helps the sloth dry off more quickly.\nEach strand of sloth fur has grooves that collect algae. The algae give the sloth a greenish color, which helps it blend in with its leafy environment. Along with sloths' slow movement, this disguise makes sloths hard for predators to spot.\nSloths also have long, curved claws on their front and back legs. Sloths can use their claws to protect themselves from predators. More importantly, the long, sharp claws curve around branches for a powerful grip. In this way, sloths' claws keep them from slipping and falling out of trees.\nHanging upside down all day can be hard for other reasons. In most animals, hanging would cause the stomach, heart, and other organs to press on the lungs. Not for sloths, though. Sloths have special bands of tissue called adhesions that help attach certain organs to the rib cage. These bands of tissue hold the organs in place so they don't press down on the sloth's lungs.

The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\nTo determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with bumpy fruit or smooth fruit, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fruit texture trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for bumpy fruit, is dominant over the f allele, which is for smooth fruit.\nBumpy fruit is the dominant allele's version of the fruit texture trait. A bumpy fruit plant has bumpy fruit. So, the F allele must occur as the organism's genotype for the fruit texture gene.\nSmooth fruit is the recessive allele's version of the fruit texture trait. A smooth fruit plant has smooth fruit. So, the f allele must occur as the organism's genotype for the fruit texture gene.\nThe Punnett square shows that each box has at least one bumpy fruit phenotype and one smooth fruit phenotype. So, the expected ratio of offspring with bumpy fruit to offspring with smooth fruit is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, there will be 0 offspring with bumpy fruit and 4 offspring with smooth fruit."}, {"id": "identity_1734", "response": "Maps have four cardinal directions, or main directions.

The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.\nTemperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.\nWhat happens if the amount of matter changes?

An allusion lets you reference ideas from an entire story in just a few words.\n\"I'd better get home before I turn into a pumpkin!\" Lila remarked.\nHere, Lila alludes to the fairy tale \"Cinderella,\" in which Cinderella must leave the ball before the coach that brought her transforms into a pumpkin. The allusion shows that Lila must depart immediately.The source of the allusion leap of faith is ancient legend.\nIn many ancient cultures, people believed that people were born into the world with a specific mission. If a person failed to fulfill his mission, the gods would punish him by taking away his senses.\nAccording to the Bible, a prophet named Job was punished by God for failing to follow his mission. The Bible states that God took away Job's senses, and he was unable to see or hear.\nThe allusion leap of faith means to do something without preparation."}, {"id": "identity_2113", "response": "Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.\nThe strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.\nYou can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when there is a smaller distance between the magnets.The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.\nDistance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.\nThere is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."}, {"id": "identity_2114", "response": "Scientists record climate data from places around the world.

The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.\nMass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.\nThere are many different units of mass. When you are using metric units, mass may be written with units of grams or kilograms.\nThere are 1,000 grams in 1 kilogram. So, 1 gram is much less than 1 kilogram.\nA paper clip has a mass of about 1 gram, while a textbook has a mass of about 1 kilogram.The better estimate for the mass of a box of paper is 40 grams.\n40 kilograms is too heavy."}, {"id": "identity_2116", "response": "An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.\nDistance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.\nTime tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.\nThink about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving faster will go a farther distance in that time. It is moving at a higher speed.Look at the distance each sailboat moved and the time it took to move that distance.\nOne sailboat moved 30 kilometers in 5 hours.\nThe other sailboat moved 15 kilometers in 5 hours.\nNotice that each sailboat spent the same amount of time moving. The sailboat that moved 30 kilometers moved a farther distance in that time. So, that sailboat must have moved at a higher speed."}, {"id": "identity_2117", "response": "Look at the table and images.\nMaria wants broccoli. Jason wants tomatoes.
