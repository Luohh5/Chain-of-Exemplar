Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.\nFor example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene.

A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.\nSome traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits.

Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nA dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait.

Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene\u2014one allele inherited from each parent.\nAn organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.\nAn organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait.

This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.\nIf the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.\nWhen an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...\nincreases | increases\ndecreases | decreases\nstays the same | stays the sameThink about how the distance between the motorcycle and the center of Earth changed.\nThe top of the hill is higher than the bottom of the hill.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\nTo determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a white body or a brown body, consider whether each genotype includes at least one dominant allele for the body color gene. A dominant allele has the genotype BB or Bb.\nBoth the genotype BB and the genotype Bb have the genotype BB or Bb. So, these two alleles are dominant alleles for the body color gene.

The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re\u00adacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same.

The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.\nTogether, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.\nBoth bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.\nA mountain zebra's scientific name is Equus zebra.\nThe organism in the picture is Equus zebra.\nEchis coloratus is in the same genus as Equus zebra, but in a different species.\nTetrao thamin is in the same genus as Equus zebra, but in a different species.\nCervus elaphus is in the same genus as Equus zebra, but in a different species."}, {"id": "identity_691", "response": "Minerals are the building blocks of rocks.

The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.\nSome chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re\u00adacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.\nIn a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.\nA change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.\nThe law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.Step 1: Think about each change.\nMixing sand and water is a physical change. The sand and water become a different type of liquid. The sand and water still have the same mass.\nBreaking a piece of glass is a physical change. The broken pieces have different sizes.

To describe them together, we use the words chemical form and physical form. All of the substances in a chemical form are exactly the same, but different chemical forms can have different physical forms.\nFor example, see the transformation below.\nHarmful chemicals, such as boron, are converted into a substance called boric acid. The boric acid is a solid. It has a different chemical form than the harmful chemicals. But the chemical form is still boron. It is still made of boron atoms that are bonded to oxygen atoms.\nThe chemical form of a substance may be changed into a different chemical form or into a different physical form during a transformation. Sometimes, though, the chemical form stays the same.\nIf the chemical form of a substance changes, the substance's chemical symbol often has a different name. For example, the chemical form of silver is silver. But silver silver is called Cupronickel. The name of the chemical form of silver is Cupronickel silver. If the chemical form stays the same, the chemical symbol is not changed.\nA substance's physical form can change during a transformation.
